# <Throwback-Generator>

## Description:

Our team wanted to create an application that returned news, music and movies to a user when they entered their birthdate. We thought it would be fun and informative to receive news headlines from the date of your birth as well as movies and albums released the same year. Consider it a little window on history from the vantage of your birth. Thus, the 'Throwback-Generator'! Together we learned to integrate three distinct APIs in a simple, user-friendly application. We adopted a retro theme for the style in keeping with the overall concept.

## Installation and Usage:

Our application can be found at https://awnasworthy.github.io/throwback-generator/

Simply enter your birthdate and prepare to throwback!
